/// Floor on Tokio worker threads. The Lockdown-deadline and fire-driver prologues
/// both touch the synchronous channel store; if that lock is wedged, each can pin one
/// worker, so a third is what keeps the lock-free `/healthz` operations surface
/// schedulable on a one- or two-vCPU sealed host. A FLOOR and not a cap: a larger
/// sealed host keeps its `available_parallelism()` workers, which is the count Tokio
/// itself defaults to and what the daemon ran on before this floor existed.
///
/// Setting the count explicitly does mean `TOKIO_WORKER_THREADS` no longer applies,
/// and that is the intended reading: this floor exists precisely so the number cannot
/// drop below what keeps `/healthz` answerable on a wedged store, and nothing in a
/// sealed v0 deployment asks for a different one.
