//! Test-only, in-process record of the ORDER of observable operations one `/sign`
//! ingress pass performs — the op-order part of the deterministic gate for ADR-0012's
//! constant-observable-ingress rule:
//!
//! > a node performs the identical operations in the identical order … A normal
//! > spend schedules its own fire through the same mechanism the escape uses, so
//! > there is no write, timer install, or lock acquisition that duress performs and
//! > normal does not.
//!
//! [`pin::verify_pin`](crate::pin::verify_pin)'s own counting seam
//! ([`CountingEvaluator`](crate::pin::test_util::CountingEvaluator)) proves the PIN
//! COMPARE is symmetric — exactly two Argon2 evaluations, Normal then Duress, for
//! every pin class. It says nothing about the rest of the handler, which is where
//! the pin verdict actually flows: into the arm hook, into
//! [`ChannelState::apply_cached_schedule`](crate::channel::ChannelState::apply_cached_schedule),
//! and into [`register_pair`](crate::register_pair)'s arm directive. This module is
//! that broader half, and it is deliberately built the same way: a counting seam
//! whose output is compared for equality, not a clock whose noise floor exceeds the
//! effect it is meant to detect.
//!
//! **Why a SEQUENCE and not a set of counters.**
//! [`ScheduleWorkTrace`](crate::channel::ScheduleWorkTrace) already counts the
//! channel store's locks, candidate visits, and schedule writes and asserts the two
//! pins agree. Counters cannot see reordering — a duress path that took the same
//! locks in a different order, or interleaved a write differently, has a different
//! observable work shape and identical counts. Recording an ordered log makes the
//! assertion `normal == duress` over a `Vec`, which catches an added op, a dropped
//! op, and a moved op alike.
//!
//! **What the log alone cannot see, and what covers it.** Every op here is recorded
//! at the ingress path's CALL SITE, so this log is a WHITELIST: it answers "what did
//! this pass do at the places we instrumented", not "what did this pass do" and not
//! "what did this pass cost". Two things escape it and ARE covered elsewhere in
//! `channel::duress::IngressWork` — the tests compare all of its fields together, never
//! this log on its own. A third escapes it and is covered NOWHERE; it is named below,
//! because a boundary statement that lists only the gaps it closed is the overclaim
//! this module exists to stop making.
//!
//! * MEMORY-HARD COST. An extra `carrier_kdf.derive` bolted on somewhere else runs a full
//!   memory-hard evaluation and appends nothing here. Verified by construction: with a
//!   duress-only extra derivation inserted into `Node::fire_arm_hook`, the captured op
//!   logs come back BYTE-IDENTICAL under both pins. That is the ~199 ms effect the
//!   demoted wall-clock probe existed for, so the record also carries the two
//!   evaluation counters that already exist —
//!   [`Node::carrier_derivation_count`](crate::Node::carrier_derivation_count) and
//!   [`CountingEvaluator`](crate::pin::test_util::CountingEvaluator).
//! * UNINSTRUMENTED WRITES. A duress-only `store.carriers_by_nonce.insert(...)`
//!   dropped into `ChannelState::record_arm_intent` leaves this log — and the
//!   hand-placed `ScheduleWorkTrace` counters, which are a whitelist for the same
//!   reason — byte-identical under both pins. So the record also carries two canonical
//!   projections read off FIELDS rather than off any instrumentation:
//!   `channel::duress::StoreShape` over the whole channel store (pin-masked, since a
//!   carrier id is a digest of the PIN), and `channel::duress::SignStateShape` over the
//!   whole `/sign` handler state — the replay, pending, coordinator-nonce and refresh
//!   logs plus the attempt budget, which is the one piece of state the pin VERDICT is
//!   passed into. That makes net-state coverage generic across both halves of the
//!   node's mutable state. Writes to the vault-authorized set, to the PEER OUTBOX
//!   ([`Node::outbox`](crate::Node), which is neither of those two structs), and to the
//!   remaining handler locals stay covered only at this log's instrumented call sites.
//!   For the two shared structures that is a COMPLETE whitelist and is maintained as
//!   one: every production write to `Node::outbox` records [`IngressOp::OutboxPush`]
//!   and every write to `Node::authorized` records [`IngressOp::AuthorizedInsert`],
//!   including on the paths where the write is pin-uniform by construction (the
//!   `/sign` delivery-horizon refusal, which returns before the pin is evaluated) and
//!   on the pin-less refresh handler. Both are instrumented anyway, because a
//!   whitelist with silent exceptions reads as coverage it does not have. What the
//!   log still cannot see for the outbox is CONTENTS — only presence and position.
//!   Deliberately: the staged `TaggedRequest` is the coordinator's request
//!   verbatim, PIN included, so like a carrier id it differs by pin BY CONSTRUCTION and
//!   would have to be masked before it could be compared at all.
//!
//! * NON-MEMORY-HARD COST — the residual, and it is gated by nothing. A duress-only
//!   extra ECDSA verify, an extra PSBT serialize, or an O(candidates) scan appends no op
//!   here, leaves no net state in either projection, and moves neither evaluation
//!   counter. Verified by construction, and this one is NOT a near miss: a duress-only
//!   arithmetic grind inserted into `Node::fire_arm_hook`, heavy enough to take the seven
//!   cases from 0.05 s to 4.94 s of real CPU, left every one of them GREEN. That is
//!   ~25× the ~199 ms Argon2 effect the demoted wall clock existed to catch, and nothing
//!   deterministic saw it. The wall-clock skew that was once the only thing in its way is
//!   now advisory (its noise floor exceeded the effect it was aimed at), so this class
//!   has no gate at all. `12-security-requirements.md` SEC-47 (btc-policy-spec) records the same boundary; keep the
//!   two in agreement.
//!
//! Instrument new sites here for ORDER; the two evaluation counters cover MEMORY-HARD
//! cost only, and the two projections cover channel-store and `/sign`-state net state.
//! **This is a WHITELIST, and a whitelist cannot be proven complete.** Four review
//! passes each found one more piece of state outside it, which is the nature of the
//! construction rather than a defect being slowly fixed. So state the boundary instead
//! of claiming closure.
//!
//! COVERED generically: everything inside `PartialStore` and everything under the
//! `/sign` lock, via the two whole-struct projections — those destructure without `..`,
//! so a new field is a compile error, not a silent gap.
//!
//! NOT covered by the projections; an uninstrumented write is invisible to the whole
//! record, so a new write to any of these MUST record its op:
//!   * `Node::outbox`, `Node::authorized` — instrumented today at every production site.
//!   * `Node::alerts` — served verbatim over `GET /events`, an observable SILENCE names.
//!   * `ChannelState::freshness_counts` / `ingress_guards` — `/channel` path only today.
//!   * `Node::lockdown`, `last_deadline_tick`, `generation_claimed` — the `/healthz`
//!     latches. `lockdown` is the LOUDEST oracle the node can emit (it flips every later
//!     `/sign` to `FRAUD_SUSPECTED`), and it is not in either projection.
//!
//! KNOWN-UNCOVERED CLASSES, named so nobody mistakes this gate for more than it is:
//! non-memory-hard duress-only cost (see above); the VALUES behind instrumented markers
//! (`AuthorizedInsert` records that an insert happened, not which txid); the
//! nonce→carrier→intent LINKAGE, which per-value masking necessarily breaks; and the
//! preflight guard's release POINT, since `preflight_after` compares only the settled
//! depth. Each is reachable in principle by a pin-dependent regression that leaves every
//! comparison here equal.
//!
//! Nothing on the `/sign` path writes any of the uncovered state today — verified, not
//! assumed. What stands between those classes and the wire is the live harness's
//! non-timing hard gates (per-sample response bodies, body sizes, `/events`) and the
//! ordinary review of writes to shared node state. This gate is a strong net for the
//! ORDER and NET STATE of instrumented work, not a proof of pin-uniformity.
//!
//! **Why this can never become the leak it tests for.** The log lives in a
//! thread-local, is `#[cfg(test)]`, and is written only while a test has explicitly
//! opened a [`capture`] window. Nothing reaches `Node`, no handler reads it, and no
//! response, projection, or `/events` field is derived from it. A pin-dependent
//! counter readable over HTTP would BE the duress oracle ADR-0012 forbids; an
//! in-process test seam is what the pin module already established as the safe shape.
//!
//! **Why a thread-local rather than a field on [`Node`](crate::Node).** Every op below
//! is performed synchronously on its caller's thread — the peer fan-out that could
//! cross threads happens after the handler returns, from the outbox. The captures here
//! all drive `handle_sign_after_lock`, but that is not the only emitter: `ReplayWrite`,
//! `NodeSignature` and `CandidateRegister` sit in helpers (`record_verdict`,
//! `add_node_signatures`, `register_pair`) that `handle_refresh_after_lock` also calls,
//! and that handler records its own `AuthorizedLock`/`AuthorizedInsert`/`OutboxPush`
//! for the same reason the `/sign` path does, so a capture opened around a REFRESH
//! pass records all of those. Refresh is synchronous
//! on its caller's thread as well, so the thread-local argument holds for it unchanged —
//! but do not read this log as `/sign`-only when wiring one up. A thread-local scopes a
//! capture to exactly one
//! ingress pass without widening `Node`'s production shape by a field, and parallel
//! `cargo test` threads cannot contaminate each other's captures.
//!
//! **Capture boundary.** "One ingress pass" here ends when the synchronous handler
//! returns. Production then drains the outbox in [`crate::propagate_outbox`] and its
//! spawned peer sends can continue after the HTTP response. Those post-handler
//! scheduler and peer effects are outside this deterministic record; the live attack
//! scenarios exercise peer propagation, while their wall-clock comparison remains an
//! advisory signal. Do not cite this record as an end-to-end timing gate.
