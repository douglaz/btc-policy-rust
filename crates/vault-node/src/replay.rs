//! The anti-replay log (DESIGN.md, "What the anti-replay log is — and is not").
//!
//! An in-memory map from a decision identity to the verdict the node recorded.
//! Transaction-determined refusals use the `commitment_id`; accepted decisions
//! use a hash of the complete candidate set (commitment ids + ingress PSBTs), so
//! a different user-signature instance or mandatory escape cannot replay an
//! unrelated acceptance. Its jobs are idempotency and audit — it does **not**
//! defend the signature (V0-1's sighash binding does). No key is an outpoint set,
//! so an RBF replacement is a fresh commitment and is never blocked as a replay.
//!
//! Entries are pruned once their expiry has passed, so retention is bounded by
//! each commitment's node-capped expiry. `now` is always a parameter, never a
//! read of the system clock, so every path is deterministically testable.
