//! vault-node: one federation key, one policy engine, `POST /sign`.
//!
//! Scope so far (see docs/DESIGN.md "Milestones"): PIN verification, the
//! descriptor-derived policy-core checks (input ownership, destination
//! allowlist, verified change, PSBT consistency, fee cap), user
//! partial-signature verification, the anti-replay log, and the Hold
//! (ADR-0004). Under Model B (ADR-0012) a node signs its partial(s) at INGRESS,
//! pin-independently, and the Hold delays a hot-class spend's **combine +
//! broadcast** — never its signing; a partial reaches a peer only at its
//! candidate's authorized fire event (invariant 7), while escape sweeps and
//! refresh self-spends fire at ingress. The NODES then combine and broadcast:
//! `/sign` answers accepted|refusal and structurally cannot carry a signature,
//! so the coordinator stays a pure relay that never holds a finalizable
//! transaction. Watchtower duty (ADR-0001) — a callable scan pass
//! ([`Node::watchtower_tick`]) classifies recovery-path spends and spends this
//! node never validated AND policy-ACCEPTED, of the node's own chain view, and
//! queues alerts a puller reads via `GET /events` (ADR-0002). Recognition is
//! NOT "co-signed" (in t-of-n, n−t nodes legitimately sign nothing) and NOT
//! merely "evaluated" (a spend this node REFUSED must still alert, or a theft
//! fanned to honest nodes would suppress its own alert). The classification
//! stays a deterministic callable
//! pass for tests, and in the running daemon a thin background task drives it
//! on a fixed interval ([`spawn_drivers`], V0-6b) — each node is its own
//! watchtower. Duress actions and lockdown remain v0 work (V0-4).

///   is answering HTTP. It carries exactly what the `200` carries and no more — it is
///   the deliverable's named field, not an authenticated identity claim, and any
///   process on the port could emit the same byte.
/// - `locked_down` — the terminal Lockdown latch (ADR-0008). Public by construction:
///   a locked-down node already answers `FRAUD_SUSPECTED` to every spend, so this
///   reveals nothing one `/sign` would not. It is reached at `T` by
///   [`lockdown_tick`], adopted from the terminal persisted latch at startup, or
///   forced by a critical-lock poison net — never by a PIN- or arm-dependent
///   pre-`T` path — so it cannot separate an armed pre-`T` node from an idle one.
/// - `last_deadline_tick` — the coarse SAFETY deadline-driver heartbeat
///   ([`Node::last_deadline_tick`]), `None` before that driver's first pass. A plain "the
///   loop ran at time X", not "something armed or fired". Read its field doc for the
///   exact coverage: it is the deadline driver's heartbeat ALONE, so it goes stale on
///   a dead process, a starved runtime, a wedged or poison-bricked store — and NOT on
///   a release/combine/broadcast or watchtower pass stuck in a chain-backend RPC.
/// - `generation_claimed` — the one-shot process-generation marker (ADR-0007
///   reboot-death), claimed at the serving boundary before any request exists.
///
/// What is ABSENT is the point of the type, and the rule for extending it is the one
/// that kept those out: **if a pre-`T` duress carrier can change a field, the field
/// does not belong here.** No arm state, no pending/candidate counts, no `T` or any
/// hold/fire deadline, no pin class, no per-commitment anything. Each of those is the

/// **Why it exists.** `demo theft-refused`'s "the user notices the pending spend" step
/// was faithful only because the MODELLED attacker (stolen user key + PIN, but NOT the
/// coordinator auth key) has to relay through the user's OWN coordinator, which

/// it: `GET /events` carries only on-chain watchtower alerts, and no node answered
/// "what have you accepted?". This is that answer.
///
/// **Why it is not a duress oracle.** It is a function of [`replay::PendingLog`]
/// ALONE — `commitment_id -> expiry`, and nothing else — so the read NEVER touches the
/// channel store, which is where every piece of duress state lives (arm intents, `T`,
/// Armed-vs-Scheduled, the sweep and its ladder). That is structural rather than a
/// promise about which fields got picked. The log has exactly three writers, and the
/// pin class reaches none of them:
///
/// - **record**, at ingress ([`handle_sign_after_lock`]) — gated on
///   `class == TxClass::Hot` and on nothing else. A duress-pin spend and a normal-pin
///   spend of the same transaction record the SAME id under the SAME expiry.
/// - **remove** — only once a candidate has been observed ON THE NETWORK: a normal
///   spend in the mempool or the chain ([`settle_candidate`]), or a CONFIRMED armed
///   escape. Both are public events, and both drop the same two sets — the settled
///   spend's own paired sibling, and every hot spend that transaction defeated by
///   spending their inputs. The second set comes from one shared scan
///   (`channel::PartialStore::invalidate_hot_conflicts`), which the settle path reaches
///   through [`channel::ChannelState::mark_broadcast`] and the confirmation branch
///   through [`channel::ChannelState::invalidate_hot_conflicts_in_store`]. A defeated
///   candidate is terminalized in the same settlement, so an id this stops reporting
///   is one no later fire tick can broadcast.
/// - **prune**, at commitment expiry — the coordinator's own `expiry` field, which is
///   the same byte under either pin.
///
/// So at any instant, a duress-carrying node's projection can differ from the
/// equivalent normal-pin node's only AFTER a transaction the whole world can see has
/// settled. The dynamic-`T` rule corroborates that from the other side: `T <= earliest
/// pending hot Hold-expiry - epsilon_secs` (ADR-0012), so an armed node has already
/// latched the PUBLIC Lockdown — `/healthz`'s `locked_down`, plus `FRAUD_SUSPECTED` on
/// every spend — strictly before the spend it froze could have settled on the normal
/// path.
///
/// **What is deliberately absent.** [`Health`]'s rule applies unchanged ("if a pre-`T`
/// duress carrier can change a field, the field does not belong here"), and a second
/// one applies on top of it: every byte exposed here is also visible to the thief, so
/// expose only what closes the gap. Hence no fire time, `T`, Hold remainder or
/// deadline FIELD — the fire schedule is precisely what arming rewrites; no arm or
/// Armed/Scheduled state; no txid, PSBT, sighash, partial signature, amount,
/// destination or fee — the crown jewels and everything derivable from them; no escape,
/// ladder rung or bump; no count of refusals, since a refused request is never pending
/// and a refusal count would be a policy oracle; no timestamp, which would make two
/// honest nodes' bodies differ for no reason at all. Not even `expiry`, which is
/// pin-uniform and would have been safe: the id alone is what lets a user say "I did
/// not authorize that", so the expiry would be a byte handed to the attacker for
/// nothing.
///
/// **What this gives the modelled attacker.** They hold the user key, the PIN and the
/// coordinator auth key. For candidates THEY submitted this is strictly less than
/// `/sign` already handed them — `Accepted` carries this same `commitment_id` plus
/// `first_seen` and `remaining_secs`. What is genuinely new is that a coordinator-auth
/// key thief who is not also the running coordinator can now see that the USER has a
/// spend in flight: an opaque SHA-256 id with no explicit amount, destination or
/// deadline in the body, for a transaction that broadcasts publicly at the end of its

    //   WINDOW B (no lock) the confirmed-prevout chain preflight.
    //   REGISTRATION HOLD  decode, validate, sign, register ("phase 2" below).
    //
    // WHY WINDOW A EXISTS AT ALL. Both memory-hard operations are PURE functions of
    // immutable state — `verify_pin` reads `node.pin_evaluator` and the request bytes,
    // `arm_carrier_id` reads the request's auth digest and the immutable `carrier_kdf` —
    // so neither needs `sign_state`, and holding it across them made `/sign` able to
    // defer `Node::enter_lockdown`, which needs the same lock. `/sign` has no admission
    // control and the HTTP timeout does not cancel (the job detaches and continues), so
    // a post-wrench coordinator — UNTRUSTED by design, and holding the auth key — can
    // mint arbitrarily many validly-signed requests with fresh nonces and keep that
    // deferral going. Read the improvement precisely: this removes ~600 ms of
    // memory-hard work from the contended section and NOTHING MORE. The acquisition
    // delay on an unfair mutex still has NO FINITE BOUND, because a continuing flood
    // keeps admitting SUCCESSIVE jobs that overtake a waiting `enter_lockdown`. What
    // bounds the CONSEQUENCES is ADR-0012's per-carrier release gate plus
    // expiry-bounded arming, not this ordering.
    //
    // WHAT MUST NOT MOVE, and why each is load-bearing:
    //
    //  - the nonce check stays BEFORE the KDF. Moving it after would reintroduce the
    //    captured-request replay convoy the atomic consumption exists to close, and
    //    running Argon2 before coordinator auth is an unauthenticated-Argon2 DoS vector;
    //  - the §0b deliverability gates stay before the pin, so their refusals are
    //    provably identical for every pin class (no oversized/near-expiry pin oracle);
    //  - the preflight-slot claim stays INSIDE the INGRESS HOLD, or bead
    //    btc-policy-f91's refresh-overtake race reopens;
    //  - the nonce claim is installed before the lock is released, so no peer receipt
    //    can observe a consumed nonce with nothing naming the handler that consumed it
    //    (see `channel::MemoOutcome::InFlight` for what that ambiguity costs); and
    //  - the wrong-pin rate-limit backoff sleep is still taken OUTSIDE the lock, and its
    //    refresh-subordination slot is released before that sleep, so a wrong-pin flood
    //    never pins `/sign` or `/refresh` while merely backing off. The sleep is the
    //    SMALLER term now: the slot is claimed above, before the pin is evaluated, so
    //    EVERY request — wrong pins included — now holds it across WINDOW A, where before
    //    the claim sat after the budget charge and a wrong pin never took one at all. A
    //    sustained wrong-pin flood therefore keeps `spend_preflight` non-zero and answers
    //    `REFRESH_SUBORDINATED` for the whole evaluation window. Under that FLOOD it is a
    //    change of RESPONSE rather than of availability — pre-9zs the same requests held
    //    `sign_state` across the same evaluations, so a concurrent `/refresh` was blocked
    //    on the lock for that window instead of refused within it. For a SINGLE in-flight
    //    wrong-pin spend it is a real change and the stronger claim would be false: that
    //    `/refresh` used to block ~one WINDOW A and then SUCCEED (the wrong pin refused
    //    without ever taking a slot), and now it is refused with its coordinator nonce
    //    already consumed at ingress, so the coordinator must re-mint to retry. Accepted:
    //    the claim placement is not negotiable (previous bullet), the refusal is taken on
    //    the one path EVERY pin class walks so it discloses nothing about the pin, and it
    //    self-clears within WINDOW A. The disclosure is the part that was missing.
    //
    // Three things the reorder CHANGES, stated rather than left to be discovered.
    //
    // The critical section does NOT drop to "microseconds". The REGISTRATION HOLD still
    // decodes both PSBTs, validates every ladder rung, signs and registers, all under
    // this same lock; that work is unchanged and it dominates what is left.
    //
    // And the WRONG-PIN BACKOFF SEMANTICS CHANGE. The ladder itself is untouched — the
    // charge is still serialized under this lock, so successive wrong pins still draw
    // successive rungs — but the evaluation and the charge are no longer ONE critical
    // section. A burst can therefore hold several ALREADY-COMPLETED evaluations queued at
    // the budget at once (parked at the COMMIT HOLD behind, say, a REGISTRATION HOLD) and
    // charge them back to back, where the old single hold forced the memory-hard work
    // between one charge and the next; each of those that lands after the lockout has
    // tripped takes `apply = is_wrong & !locked == false` and therefore sleeps ZERO
    // (`pin::AttemptBudget::charge`).
    //
    // State the LIMIT of that precisely, because the obvious stronger claim is false:
    // WINDOW As do NOT run in parallel and a flood is NOT cheaper in wall time. Both
    // Argon2 consumers take the same node-wide work slot — `pin::CarrierKdf::work_lock`
    // hands `Argon2Evaluator` the very `Arc<Mutex<()>>` the carrier derivation locks
    // (asserted by `pin::tests::pin_and_carrier_kdfs_share_one_node_wide_memory_slot`) —
    // so the per-attempt memory-hard cost is unchanged and the pacing MOVED from
    // `sign_state` to `work_lock` rather than disappearing. What is accepted is the
    // reordering above: the LOCKOUT HORIZON is unchanged, the refusal is uniform across
    // pin classes, and the sleep was already outside this lock precisely so it could not
    // be used to pin `/sign`.
    //
    // And THE COMMIT HOLD'S THREE CLOCK PREDICATES NOW PRECEDE THE BUDGET CHARGE, so a
    // request whose WINDOW A crossed its own expiry or the delivery horizon returns
    // without charging the attempt budget, where the old single hold charged before any
    // re-check. It is disclosed rather than "fixed" because the section order is what
    // makes the MISMATCHED-generation case work at all — the stale handler must refuse
    // at expiry WITHOUT charging again — and because those exits answer
    // `COMMITMENT_EXPIRED`/`EXPIRY_TOO_SHORT` rather than a pin verdict, so no
    // informative attempt escapes the ladder and no pin class is favoured. What it does
    // cost is that a boundary-timed flood can buy PIN evaluations without advancing
    // `fails` toward lockout; that is the same admission-free-surface resource exposure
    // bead btc-policy-1y2 owns, not a verdict oracle.

/// costs the sweep its escape quorum, and lands on the two-track residual the design
/// accepts: Lockdown at `T` → funds frozen → recovery, never theft. Closing it outright
/// would need receipts to carry non-forgeable evidence of local admission — a second
/// agreement round that buys no fund safety over the argument above.
///
/// The margin must be provisioned to cover LOCAL ingress processing too, not just the
/// wire. This gate is evaluated before the pin, so everything between it and the outbox
/// write — both pin Argon2 evaluations, the serialized carrier derivation, PSBT decode,
/// user-signature verification, and signing — is spent inside the margin, and each peer
/// then spends its own share before its freshness check. A boundary-valid carrier can
/// therefore still reach peers expired. That is deliberately NOT re-checked before
/// staging: the check would sit AFTER the pin hook has already recorded this node's
/// intent, so its only possible action is to skip the fan-out — deterministically
/// dropping a duress signal that best-effort propagation might still have delivered in
/// time. It buys nothing in exchange, because a carrier that lands expired gathers no
/// genuine receipts, and the signer argument above holds regardless of how many nodes
/// admit it. The margin is a provisioning parameter; consuming it is an availability
/// question, and only refusing early can answer it.
///
/// Pin-independent by construction (it reads only `expiry` and the clock), and

///
/// Skipped in absent-channel mode, exactly like its sibling
/// [`ensure_request_propagatable`]: a node with no `[channel]` block has no peers to

///    size, so a strictly higher fee is necessarily a strictly higher FEERATE

///    default incremental relay rate, so a one-satoshi increase cannot pass ingress

///
/// - `Accepted` — this node validated, signed, and registered this exact candidate
///   set, including its user-signature instance and mandatory escape. Replaying
///   the acknowledgement is the idempotency job, and it makes a coordinator retry
///   safe without letting a conflicting pair borrow the earlier acceptance.
/// - `DEST_NOT_ALLOWED` / `CHANGE_NOT_DERIVABLE` / `FEE_EXCEEDS_CAP` /
///   `PSBT_INCONSISTENT` from the class predicate — the policy refusals that turn
///   solely on the outputs and fee the commitment binds. Because the outputs are
///   commitment-bound, the same commitment can NEVER become an acceptance, so
///   caching the refusal cannot block an honest spend. (An untrusted bip32 change
///   label only decides `DEST_NOT_ALLOWED` vs `CHANGE_NOT_DERIVABLE`; both are
///   refusals, so replaying either stays safe.)
///
/// Refusals that depend on data the commitment does NOT bind — the signature
/// (`USER_SIG_INVALID`, `BAD_SIGHASH`), the PSBT structure, or the untrusted
/// `witness_utxo` prevout script (`UNKNOWN_INPUT`) — are NOT recorded: an
/// identical commitment resubmitted with corrected witness data could legitimately
/// be accepted, so caching would otherwise replay a stale refusal and block an
/// honest spend. The log does not defend the signature — V0-1's sighash binding
/// does (DESIGN.md, "What the anti-replay log is — and is not").
///
/// `EXPIRY_TOO_SHORT` and `REFRESH_*` are likewise unrecorded: each turns on the
/// node's CLOCK or on state outside the commitment (a pending spend, a coin's last
/// refresh), so the same commitment can legitimately earn a different verdict
/// later. Caching them would make a transient "not yet" permanent.
///
/// `PSBT_INCONSISTENT` is not recordable in general (it can come from witness
/// data), so the class refusals ride the general rule and are simply re-derived on
/// resubmission — cheap, and always right.
///
/// **`HOT_BUDGET_EXCEEDED` is a deliberate EXCLUSION, and the reason is not the one
/// the rule above would give.** Read literally it qualifies: the per-transaction Hot
/// budget (ADR-0014 §1) turns solely on the outputs the commitment binds, exactly
/// like `DEST_NOT_ALLOWED`, and caching it could never block a spend that might
/// later be accepted. It is excluded anyway because it is the ONE refusal reaching
/// here that also stages the duress carrier (see the `verify_spend` refusal branch
/// in [`handle_sign_after_lock`]; the same code raised on the request's paired
/// escape carries an `escape:` check prefix, stages nothing, and never reaches this
/// predicate at all). A commitment-keyed replay hit returns BEFORE that
/// staging branch, so a recorded per-tx verdict would let one submission poison this
/// node's cache and then silently suppress a later duress carrier for the same
/// commitment — the coercer's second, duress-pinned submission would be answered from
/// cache, never staged, never counted toward t-of-n confirmation, and the freeze
/// would not fire. Capping the loss must not buy that. Re-deriving the verdict is
/// deterministic and cheap, so the exclusion costs nothing.
///
/// Adding `RefusalCode::HotBudgetExceeded` to the match below therefore breaks an
/// ADR-0014 composition guarantee, not merely an optimisation.
/// `resubmitting_an_over_cap_commitment_still_stages_the_duress_carrier` is the
