//! Pure policy-check evaluation for the federated vault.
//!
//! No I/O, no clock, no chain access — same inputs, same verdict on every
//! node; vault-node owns all resolution. See docs/DESIGN.md ("Policy model")
//! and CONTEXT.md for the vocabulary ("policy" must always be qualified).
//!
//! V0-5 makes every "does this script belong to a known descriptor within a
//! bounded index?" question run through ONE re-derivation primitive
//! ([`derives_within`]): input ownership, verified change, and the destination
//! allowlist all re-derive scripts from descriptors instead of matching literal
//! scriptPubKeys. This is why the allowlist is descriptors + a bounded index
//! rather than fixed addresses — a static address list would force address
//! reuse on the hot and escape wallets forever (DESIGN.md, "Destination
//! allowlist"; CONTEXT.md, "Allowlist").
//!
//! The checks this crate ships: PSBT consistency, input ownership, destination
//! allowlist + verified change, the fee cap (ADR-0006), and the per-transaction
//! **Hot budget** (ADR-0014) — the allowlist bounds WHERE a hot spend pays, the
//! Hot budget bounds HOW MUCH. Its rolling-window sibling needs node state, so it
//! lives in vault-node; only the pure, per-transaction half is here. Sighash
//! enforcement and the Hold live in vault-node, as does the chain backend: the
//! node resolves every input's prevout against bitcoind (`run_prevout_check`)
//! BEFORE calling `evaluate`, so the `witness_utxo` this crate reads has already
//! been cross-checked. This crate itself stays chain-view-free.
//!
//! One non-PSBT invariant lives here too, over the same descriptors:
//! [`check_descriptor_network_kind`] — extended-key flavour versus the sealed network.
