# Protocol test vectors

Part of the core-proven gate's artifact set (bead `btc-policy-9y5.8` deliverable 2).

Frozen byte-level vectors for every domain-separated hash this protocol commits to. They exist
so an **independent implementation, or a reviewer with a hex editor, can verify the wire format
without reading the Rust** — and so any accidental change to a preimage layout fails a test
instead of silently forking the federation.

Each vector below is asserted in the codebase; the "pinned by" column names the test. If you
change a preimage and these do not fail, the test is not doing its job.

| Domain | Tag | Pinned by (`crates/vault-node/src/channel.rs`) |
|---|---|---|
| Channel key | `btc-policy/channel-key/v0` | `channel_key_vector_is_frozen` |
| Manifest | `btc-policy/manifest/v0` | `manifest_vector_is_frozen` |
| Channel endorsement | `btc-policy/channel-endorsement/v0` | `endorsement_vector_is_frozen` |
| Channel envelope | `btc-policy/channel-envelope/v0` | `envelope_vector_is_frozen` |
| User sig hash | `btc-policy/user-sig-hash/v0` | `user_sig_hash_vector_is_frozen` |
| Coordinator request | `btc-policy/coord-request/v0` | `coord_request_vector_is_frozen` (in `crates/vault-proto/src/lib.rs`) |

## The hash construction

Every digest uses the same BIP340-style tagged hash (`vault_proto::tagged_hash`):

```
tagged_hash(tag, msg) = SHA256( SHA256(tag) ‖ SHA256(tag) ‖ msg )
```

where `tag` is the ASCII tag string **without** a trailing NUL. Domain separation is what stops
a signature over one structure from being replayable as a signature over another, so an
implementation that skips the doubled tag hash is not compatible — it is a different protocol
that happens to interoperate until it doesn't.

### Encoding conventions

The preimages are built with one small encoder (`Enc`), and there are only five moves:

| Move | Encoding |
|---|---|
| `fixed(bytes)` | the bytes, no prefix (used for 32-byte ids and 33-byte compressed pubkeys) |
| `u16(v)` / `u32(v)` / `u64(v)` | **little-endian**, 2 / 4 / 8 bytes |
| `u8(v)` | one byte |
| `var(bytes)` | `u32` LE length prefix, then the bytes |
| `endpoints(list)` | `u32` LE count, then each entry as `var` |

Little-endian throughout, and every variable-length field is length-prefixed — so no
concatenation ambiguity exists (`[a, b]` can never encode the same as `[ab]`).

One encoding outside these vectors uses the OTHER convention: `Commitment::canonical_bytes` in
`vault-proto` (the input to `commitment_id`) is big-endian on every integer. It is not a tagged
hash and not a signature preimage; do not carry this file's convention into it.

## Vector 1 — Channel key

```
tag    : btc-policy/channel-key/v0
msg    : 1111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111
digest : 39d6dee9b0db353e509ef6daa3885eccb21dc01b4b471369b98cd6f3253f20c7
```

The channel key is derived from the node's federation signing key under this tag, so a channel
key can never be mistaken for — or used as — a Bitcoin signing key.

## Vector 2 — Manifest (`BaseManifest`)

The manifest hash is the vault's identity: every node checks its own computed hash against the
sealed anchor at startup and refuses to boot on a mismatch. That refusal is the mechanism that
makes the federation-uniform values *provably* uniform.

**Field order** (this is the whole schema):

```
# This block and ADR-0013 §4's canonical list encode the SAME preimage. ADR-0013's copy has been
# wrong three times (missing escape_feerate_floor, escape_coverage_pct, and both u32 counts);
# this one has not. THIS DOCUMENT IS THE AUTHORITY: on any divergence the vector wins, because it
# is executable against the code. ADR-0013 §4 and ADR-0016 §3a both defer here.
wallet_id                     fixed 32
protocol_version              u32
coordinator_auth_pubkey       fixed 33   (compressed)
max_msg_bytes                 u64
hot_budget.max_per_tx_sat     u64
hot_budget.max_per_window_sat u64
hot_budget.window_secs        u64
hot_allowlist                 u32 count, then each descriptor as var
                              (canonicalized, sorted, deduped — order carries no policy meaning)
                              = the node's `allowlist` MINUS `escape_descriptor` (ADR-0014). The
                              vector below cannot show the exclusion — its allowlist has one entry.
escape_descriptor             var
max_derivation_index          u32
escape_feerate_floor          u64        <- fire-time selector input
escape_coverage_pct           u8         <- fire-time selector input
escape_bump_max_fee_pct       u8         <- sealed ladder ceiling (ADR-0016 §3a)
network                       u8         <- sealed vault network: 1=bitcoin,
                                            2=DEFAULT PUBLIC signet, 3=regtest.
                                            EXPLICIT codes, never an enum ordinal.
nodes                         u32 count, then per node:
                                node_id          u16
                                signing_pubkey   fixed 33
                                channel_pubkey   fixed 33
                                endpoints        u32 count, then each as var (UTF-8)
```

**Vector** — `wallet_id = 0x22*32`, `protocol_version = 2`, coordinator pubkey `03 8a3b…`,
`max_msg_bytes = 1048576`, hot budget `(0x11111111, 0x22222222, 0x33333333)`, allowlist

```

The same membership at `network = signet (0x02)` digests to
`e0d59168e0eec3c41ca3834f6fe109d4dbeadf9019018bcc6cc266b1162369ae` and at
`network = regtest (0x03)` to
`658e60a29ed973b968c793928cab6647f4df525403c1c2323a6961e79d54b04d`. Two more values than
a single vector needs, deliberately: one vector cannot distinguish an encoder that writes
the sealed network from one that writes a constant. All three are asserted over exactly this
membership by `manifest_vector_is_frozen`, which also pins byte 148 to a literal `1`/`2`/`3`.

(The preimage is one contiguous byte string; it is broken across lines above only to show the
field boundaries. The canonical single-line form is `FROZEN_MANIFEST_PREIMAGE_HEX`.)

Note `0100000000000000` (floor = 1), `5f` (coverage = 95), `00`
(`escape_bump_max_fee_pct` = 0) and `01` (network = bitcoin) sitting between
`max_derivation_index` and the node count. The first two are hash-bound precisely so a node
provisioned with a different fire-time selector cannot boot into this federation. The third is
hash-bound for the reason ADR-0016 §3a gives: "sealed" means in the PREIMAGE, and a ceiling
present only in `manifest.json` would be a value the ceremony writes and no node is bound to.
Nodes never enforce it (§4a) — they only prove it uniform. Appending that one byte is why
`protocol_version` was `1`, and `0` before that.

The fourth byte is the sealed **vault network**. Its codes are written out by hand
(`1`/`2`/`3`) and are NOT `Network as u8`: rust-bitcoin inserted `Testnet4` between `Testnet`
and `Signet`, so an ordinal-derived preimage would have silently renumbered signet and regtest
— changing the manifest hash of every already-sealed vault on a dependency bump. Appending it
is why `protocol_version` is `2` here. Only `1`, `2` and `3` exist; testnet3, testnet4 and
custom signets have no code, and adding one is a future manifest revision.

## Vector 3 — Channel endorsement

Each node's signing key vouches for its own channel key. The manifest's `channel_pubkey` is
trusted *because* this endorsement verifies — the wire envelope carries no endorsement.

```
fields : wallet_id(32) ‖ manifest_hash(32) ‖ node_id(u16) ‖ channel_pubkey(33)
         ‖ protocol_version(u32) ‖ endpoints(u32 count, then each as var UTF-8)

preimage:

```

`protocol_version` is inside these bytes, so an endorsement collected at revision 1 does not
verify at revision 2 — the signature binds the schema revision, not just the membership.

## Vector 4 — Channel envelope

Every peer-to-peer message is signed over this. The `msg_type` is length-prefixed and the nonce
and timestamp are inside the signed bytes, which is what makes replay and cross-type confusion
detectable.

```
fields : msg_type(var) ‖ protocol_version(u32) ‖ wallet_id(32) ‖ manifest_hash(32)
         ‖ from_node(u16) ‖ to_node(u16) ‖ payload(var) ‖ nonce(var; 16 bytes in v0) ‖ timestamp(u64)

## Vector 5 — User sig hash

Pinned in-tree by `user_sig_hash_vector_is_frozen` (`crates/vault-node/src/channel.rs`).

## Vector 6 — Coordinator request

Pinned by `coord_request_vector_is_frozen` in `crates/vault-proto/src/lib.rs` (added 2026-09-09;
until then this file claimed the commitment-binding tests pinned it, and they did not — they
compare two constructions of the same value, so a field reordering left them green). The
coordinator digest is:

```
tagged_hash("btc-policy/coord-request/v0", wallet_id ‖ canonical_bytes(request))
```

The `wallet_id` prefix is load-bearing: it domain-separates the signature to **one vault**, so a
coordinator signature captured from one vault cannot be replayed against another that happens to
share a coordinator key. It is never transmitted; signer and verifier each supply their own.

```
fields : tag(u8: 0x01 = Spend, 0x02 = Refresh)
         Spend   : ‖ spend_psbt(var) ‖ escape_psbt(var) ‖ escape_bumps(u32 count, each var)
                   ‖ pin(var) ‖ nonce(var) ‖ expiry(u64) ‖ policy_version(u32)
         Refresh : ‖ refresh_psbt(var) ‖ nonce(var) ‖ expiry(u64) ‖ policy_version(u32)
         PSBTs are bound as their exact base64 ASCII, un-decoded. The bump count is written even
         when it is zero, so a dropped trailing rung changes the bytes.

inputs : wallet_id=0x11*32, expiry=1752500000, policy_version=1

## How to verify these

```
nix develop -c cargo test --locked -p vault-node --lib vector_is_frozen
nix develop -c cargo test --locked -p vault-proto
```

An independent implementation should reproduce every digest above from the field descriptions
alone. If it cannot, one of the two is wrong — and the vectors, not the prose, are normative.

## Caveats

- These vectors pin **manifest schema revision 2** — the value `protocol_version` carries, and
  NOT the routable/authenticated transport v1, which is separate work. The domain tags stay
  `/v0`: they separate domains, not revisions, and retagging them would invalidate every digest
  for no gain. `protocol_version` is inside the manifest preimage, so a revision bump is a new
  manifest and therefore a new vault (see `docs/UPGRADE-AND-ROTATION-POLICY.md`). Revision 0's
  and 1's vectors are not reproduced here; sealed hosts take no upgrade-in-place (ADR-0005), so
  an older vault keeps computing its own revision's bytes with the binary it was sealed with.
- **What the network byte does and does not do.** It makes the vault's chain federation-uniform:
  a node configured for another chain computes a different `manifest_hash` and fails startup.
  That is ALL it does here. It does not change BIP32 derivation or any scriptPubKey; it does not
  prove the backend a node dials is on that chain (a separate startup check compares Core's own
  `chain` and, for signet, its `signet_challenge`); it does not distinguish two regtest
  instances, nor a fork that still reports `chain:"main"`; and it does not bind the hot/Escape
  extended-key FLAVOUR to the sealed network. That relation is enforced OUTSIDE the preimage, by
  one `policy-core` validator run independently at assemble, at finalize and at node load
  (`btc-policy-descriptor-network-kind-x00`). No byte was added for it and these digests are
  unchanged — which is exactly why a fully hash-consistent revision-2 set whose flavour disagrees
  is REFUSED rather than re-hashed, and why the remedy is a new ceremony rather than an edit.
- The vectors cover hash **preimages and digests**, not signature encodings. Signatures are
  DER-encoded ECDSA over secp256k1 with the usual Bitcoin conventions.
- Vectors 5 and 6 are referenced rather than reproduced here; a reviewer wanting full
  independence should extract them from the named tests the same way vectors 1–4 were extracted.
